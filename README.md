## Why Piecutter?
Piecutter CLI is a project highly inspired by the well-known <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter" target="_blank">Cookiecutter</a> project. 

*But why another CLI app inspired in a well established one?*

A lot of data scientists need to put models into production right after the modeling phase, and Cookiecutter doesn't help with this important step of the machine learning lifecycle. Moreover, the project template generated by Cookiecutter has some files and folders that we, as data scientists, don't use very often in a research-to-production environment. Piecutter generates a much more cleaner structure of folders and files for the research phase of a ML project.

*And about the production phase?*

Piecutter implements a standardized way to put trained models and ML pipelines into production by using BentoML. BentoML is a tool to standardize the process of ML model deployment by building an inference API around your trained pipeline as well as containerizing this application with docker, making it available for deployment right off the bat.

*But why should I use Piecutter CLI if BentoML exists?*

Well, BentoML's development is in full swing, and this is good and bad at the same time. Although very standardized, the BentoML team constantly make significant changes on the package design, which affects not only the user experience, but also makes the official documentation outdated very fast. Piecutter puts all this mess out of your sight and gives you few commands for you to generate your entire research environment structure as well as to generate your production-ready inference API code in a matter of seconds.

Moreover, BentoML isn't capable of generating the research and the production structure in the same codebase, it isn't meant for that actually. Piecutter takes care of this integration and on top of that implements *Custom Runnables* for any unsupported framework as well as for more complex AI pipelines just by running one or two commands.

## Supported Frameworks
The first version of Piecutter has just been released and for now the package only has support for **PyCaret** deployment. *You can expect support for all major frameworks in the coming days (I'm developing this package in my spare time, as fast as I can)*.

## Installation
To install `piecutter-cli` it's really simple.

    $ pip install piecutter-cli
